# UFC-Analysis
Worked through a scrapped database provided through Kaggle. The database contained various information about UFC fighters. The <a href="(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata)"> link </a> is provided.
# Project Goals
After looking through the data, I wanted to first know which side won more often. Which then led to why did red fighters win more often? Then the hypothesis was created, experience affects the outcome of the fight, meaning that red fighters have more experience.
## Key Questions
- Does red or blue side win more often?
- Why do red fighters win more often than blue fighters?
- Do rounds have an impact on the wins?
- Does age affect wins?
- Is experience the key influence on the outcome of the fight?
