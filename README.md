# UFC-Analysis
Worked through a scrapped database provided through Kaggle. The database contained various information about UFC fighters. The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata"> link </a> is provided.
# Project Goals
After looking through the data, I wanted to first know which side won more often. This then led to why red fighters win more often. Then the hypothesis was created, experience affects the outcome of the fight, meaning that red fighters have more experience.
## Key Questions
- Does the red or blue side win more often?
- Why do red fighters win more often than blue fighters?
- Do rounds have an impact on the wins?
- Does age affect wins?
- Is experience the key influence on the outcome of the fight?
# Final Deliverable
Refer to <a href="https://github.com/MaverickFigueira/UFC-Analysis/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20UFC"> attached files </a> to review my work with Python. Within the file, you will see how I answered each of these questions with visualizations and data manipulation. 
I also compiled a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maverick.figueira/viz/UFCFighterTrends_17131164989310/Story1?publish=yes"> tableau presentation </a>  that not only shows my hypothesis, but also has recommendations for the UFC to consider to create more interesting fights, and questions to ask if they want to expand their viewer base.
